                    <p>Hello! My name is Dakota Heninger and I am a Web Developer! I am a recent graduate from V School
                        in Salt Lake City, Utah. I attended V School to learn and sharpen my skills through an intensive
                        Full Stack Javascript Course. I have a passion for Web Development and enjoy pushing myself to
                        the limits to learn and grow! I also have a passion for many other things, these include:
                        Fishing, Hunting, Snowboarding, Video Games, Movies, Binge Watching Netflix, and above all
                        others, Sports. As I believe this site shows, I have a love for sports! I love playing sports,
                        watching sports, fantasy sports, all things sports! The passion I have for coding and sports is
                        what pushed me to design/build this website alongside one of my very close friends Loren Pabst
                        who happens to be an absolutely amazing Web Developer! </p>
