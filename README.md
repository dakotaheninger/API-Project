# Sports API (NOT FINISHED)
<p>As I hope my GitHub shows I have a passion for code. As my GitHub also shows, I have a passion for Sports.</p>
<p>When I was given the assignment to build a site using an API I got really excited. I have tried to mesh my passions in different ways over the course of my coding career, but this was the first time I felt that I could really bring them together. This project is still in progress and as I learn more I will continue to come back and work to make it better!</p>
